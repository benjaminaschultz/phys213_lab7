    "# Ising Model in 1D and 2D: Metropolis Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll be studying the [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model), a simple model of magnetization in solid crystals, that been mapped to many other physical, biological and sociological phenomena. The goal is for you to come away with some familiarity with how magnetic solids are formed and how to use simulations to the study a physical process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ising model, we consider atoms at lattice points in a crystal with spin $s$, which can take on values of $s=\\pm1$. They are often represented as arrows like this\n",
    "![spins](images/spin_up_spin_down.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have discussed in our lectures on atomic physics spins give particles agular momentum, which in turn give them a magentic moment. In the Ising Model each spin (i) interacts with only its neighbors (j), with an interaction energy\n",
    "$$ U_{ij} = - s_i s_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we put a few spins in a line (a 1-D crystal), our system starts to looks like this.\n",
    "![fig1](images/1d_fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The squares below the spins are an alternate representation of our model (black => $s=+1$ grey => $s=-1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize the interactions of a particular atom by looking how it is aligned relative to its neighbors. The selected atom has two favorable interactions depicted in green. It would have a energy of $U=-2$.\n",
    "![fig2](images/1d_fig2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When studying a solid, physics typically like to understand what happens in the bulk material. However, on a computer, we are limited to study a finite collection of atoms (or we would need an infinite amount of memory!), so we can cheat a little bit by using periodic boundary conditions to remove edges from our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig3](images/1d_fig3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the atom would have $U = 0$, because it is aligned with one of its neighbors and anti-aligned with the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab, we'll also do some simulations in 2D. In that case, our system will look like a grid of atoms, each interacting with its 8 neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig4](images/2d_fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The depicted atom is this case would have $U = -2$ because it is aligned with 5 of its neighbors and anti-aligned with 3 of them. Like in 1-D we use periodic boundary conditions, so the top connects to the bottom and the left connects to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we study with the Ising model is understanding why at some temperatures a ferromagnet (like the ones on your fridge), would demagnetize (or \"melt\"), while at other temperatures, nearly every spin in the entire magnet is aligned (producing a bulk magnetic dipole moment). To do this, we connect the model we've define here to a thermal bath - a source of random thermal energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Ising model at finite temperature: a crash course in statistical physics\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a \"thermal bath\" as an infinitely large block of material and a temperature $T$. Any thing that is coupled to it, will eventually also come to equilibrium at temperature $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we imagine our magnet is placed in contact with a thermal bath, our atoms will now be subjected to a barrage of random energetic fluctions; the higher the temperature the more energy these flucuations have.\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt a probabilistic view of our model where the probability of a given state being observed P is proportional to the negative exponentional of its energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(s_1, s_2, ...) \\propto \\exp(-U(s_1, s_2, ...) / k_BT)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the Boltzmann distribution and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. For convenience this is often rewritten with $\\beta = 1/k_BT$ so\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P \\propto \\exp(-\\beta U) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As our system evolves, it will sample different \"microstates\" - specific configurations of spins. At the human scale the precise configuration of spins does not matter, as much as the the average characteristics of the spin configuration behavior. These \"macrostates\" represent a collection of microstates with similar properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a system grows to infinite size, the relatively probabilities of different macrostates grow dramatically, and the system typically evolves into a particular macrostate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Ising-model system, we'll describe the macrostates in terms of the average energy of atoms in the crystal, and the magnetization (the sum of all the spins). If most atoms are aligned with their neighbors, the the energy will be low. If most atoms are aligned over the entire crystal, the magnetization will have a finite value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U = \\sum_{ij} U_{ij} = - \\sum s_i s_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M = \\sum_i s_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metropolis Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not possible to solve for the behavior of the Ising model in closed form. However, we can use computers to simulate its behavior. To do that we'll use the [Metropolis Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) algorithm to sample different microstates and then observe the macrostates by computing U and M.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll gloss of the the details, but it proceeds basically by a weighted trial and error procedure that is guaranteed to evolve your model into thermal equilibrium for infinite trials (but you only need to do a finite number).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you specify a random configuration of spins. This is your initial state, then\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly select a spin and flip it ($s_{new} = - s_{old}$)\n",
    "1. If this move lowers the total system energy U, accept it. If it doesn't accept it with $P = \\exp-\\beta\\Delta U$\n",
    "1. Repeat. Each of cycle is called a \"move.\" A \"sweep\" is when you have attempted to flip every spin in your system\n",
    "\n",
    "After many sweeps, your system is in thermal equilbrium. As you continue to make moves, you'll sample different microstates that correspond the the equilibrium macrostate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains code to run MC simulations of the Ising model in one and two dimensions. As we run the model, we'll compute its energy and magnetization every so often, and take snapshots of the model's microstate. Rather than using the arrow representation, we'll used black and white images to represent the spins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local ordering and Spatial Autocorrelations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fially, I wanted to introduce you to another way of charaterizing the microstructure of a solid (or fluid). At many temperatures you will find that the magnetization will be zero (or very close to it). However, the microstates you see will look different to your eyes - you'll see \"grains.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These are regions of local order - clumps of aligned spins. If we'd like to characterize their size, we can use something called the spatial autocorrelation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start in 1D by defining our spin field S(x). It's just the spin at the lattice site x.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S(x_i) = s_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The autocorrelation is defined by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R(\\Delta x) = \\sum_x S(x+\\Delta x) S(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on average, a spin at a distance $\\Delta x$ away from any lattice point, has the same spin, this function will be positive. If, on average, they are not correlated, it will be zero. If, on average, the spin is in the the opposite direction, it will be negative. If 2Dthe definitely is basically the same, but we perform a radial average, over some separation $\\Delta r$ between lattice sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at a result from a 2 dimensional simulation with M=0 and look at its radial distribution function we can see that as the separation distance $\\Delta r$ grows, the autocorrelation function decays. The width of that decay is set by the \"grain size\" in the simulation.\n",
